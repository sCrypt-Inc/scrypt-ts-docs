# The Official sCrypt 1Sat Ordinals SDK

sCrypt offers its official [1Sat Ordinals](https://docs.1satordinals.com/) SDK named [`scrypt-ord`](https://github.com/sCrypt-Inc/scrypt-ord).

The SDK offers an easy to use interface for deploying and transferring 1Sat Ordinals and augmenting them with the power of sCrypt smart contracts.

It facilitates the development of smart contracts for both non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens (FTs).


## Installation

It is recommended that you [create an sCrypt project](../installation.md#the-scrypt-cli-tool) using our CLI tool. Once you have the project set up, simply run the following command:

```
npm i scrypt-ord
```
