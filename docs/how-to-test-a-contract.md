# How to Test a Contract

Before using a smart contract in production, one should always test it carefully, especially because any bug in it may cause **real economic losses**.

There are two different kinds of tests recommended for every project using `sCrypt`:

* **Local Unit Testing**
* **Testnet Integration Testing**

Now we will take a look at the file `tests/local/demo.ts`. This file contains code for deployment of our `Demo` contract on the Bitcoin testnet and a subsequent public method call on the contract.

But before going into details, you should learn some basic models of sCrypt for signing and sending transactions.

## Compile the Contract

First, call function `SmartContract.compile()` to compile the contract before doing any testing.

```ts
await Demo.compile()
```

## Provider

A `Provider` is an abstraction of a standard Bitcoin node that provides connection to the Bitcoin network, for read and write access to the blockchain.

sCrypt already has a few built-in providers:

* `DummyProvider`: A mockup provider just for local tests. It does not connect to the Bitcoin blockchain and thus cannot send transactions.

* `DefaultProvider`:  The default provider is the safest, easiest way to begin developing on Bitcoin, and it is also robust enough for use in production. It can be used in testnet as well as mainnet.

* See full list of providers [here](./reference/classes/Provider.md#hierarchy).

You can initialize these providers like this:

```ts
let dummyProvider = new DummyProvider();

// mainnet

let provider = new DefaultProvider();

// testnet

let provider = new DefaultProvider(bsv.Networks.testnet);
```

## Signer

A `Signer` is an abstraction of private keys, which can be used to sign messages and transactions. A simple signer would be a single private key, while a complex signer is a wallet.

### TestWallet

For testing purposes only, we have a built-in wallet called `TestWallet`. It can be created like this:

```ts
const signer = new TestWallet(privateKey, provider);
```

`privateKey` can be a single private key or an array of private keys that the wallet can use to sign transactions. The ability of the wallet to send transactions is assigned to `provider`. In other words, a `TestWallet` serves as both a signer and a provider.

## Test a Contract Locally

Compared to other blockchains, smart contracts on Bitcoin are **pure**.

* Given the same input, its public method always returns the same boolean output: success or failure. It has no internal state.
* A public method call causes no side effects.

Smart contracts are similar to mathematical functions. Thus, we can test a contract locally without touching the Bitcoin blockchain. If it passes tests off chain, we are confident it will behave the same on chain.

### Prepare a Signer and Provider

The `TestWallet` and `DummyProvider` combination would be ideal for local tests because it can sign the contract call transactions without actually sending them.

Such a signer may be declared as below:

```ts
let signer = new TestWallet(privateKey, new DummyProvider());
```

Then just connect it to your contract instance like this:

```ts
await instance.connect(signer);
```

### Call a Public Method

To facilitate calling a contracts' public `@method`, we have injected a runtime object named `methods` in your contract class. For each public `@method` of your contract (e.g., `contract.foo`), a function with the same name and signature (including list of parameters and return type, i.e., void) is added into `methods` (e.g., `contract.methods.foo`). In addition, there is an `options` appended as the last paramter.

Assume you have a contract like this:

```ts
Class MyContract extends SmartContract {
  ...
  @method()
  public foo(arg1, arg2) {...}
}
```
You can check it like this:

```ts
let instance = new MyContract();
console.log(typeof instance.methods.foo) // output `function`
```

This function is designed to invoke the corresponding `@method` of the same name on chain, meaning calling it will spend the previous contract UTXO in a new transaction. You can call it like this:

```ts
// Note: `instance.methods.foo` should be passed in all arguments and in the same order that `instance.foo` would take.

// Additionally, it can accept an optional "opts" argument to control the behavior of the function.

const { tx, atInputIndex } = await instance.methods.foo(arg1, arg2, options);
```


#### MethodCallOptions

The `options` argument is of type `MethodCallOptions`:

```ts
/**
 * A option type to call a contract public `@method` function.
 * Used to specify the behavior of signers and transaction builders.
 * For example, specifying a transaction builder to use a specific change address or specifying a signer to use a specific public key to sign.
 */
export interface MethodCallOptions<T> {
  /**
   * The private key(s) associated with these address(es) or public key(s)
   * must be used to sign the contract input,
   * and the callback function will receive the results of the signatures as an argument named `sigResponses`
   * */
  readonly pubKeyOrAddrToSign?: PublicKeysOrAddressesOption;
  /** The subsequent contract instance(s) produced in the outputs of the method calling tx in a stateful contract */
  readonly next?: StatefulNext<T>[] | StatefulNext<T>,
  /** The `lockTime` of the method calling tx */
  readonly lockTime?: number;
  /** The `sequence` of the input spending previous contract UTXO in the method calling tx */
  readonly sequence?: number;
  /** The previous contract UTXO to spend in the method calling tx */
  readonly fromUTXO?: UTXO;
  /** The P2PKH change output address */
  readonly changeAddress?: AddressOption;
  /** verify the input script before send transaction */
  readonly verify?: boolean;
  /** Whether to call multiple contracts at the same time in one transaction */
  readonly multiContractCall?: true;
  /** Pass the `ContractTransaction` of the previous call as an argument to the next call, only used if `multiContractCall = true`.  */
  readonly partialContractTx?: ContractTransaction;
}
```

What actually happens during the call is the following.

1. Build an unsigned transaction by calling the tx builder, which can be a default or a customized one introduced in [this section](./how-to-deploy-and-call-a-contract/how-to-customize-a-contract-tx#customizedcalltxbuilder), for a public `@method`.

2. Use the instance's signer to sign the transaction. Note that `instance.foo` could be invoked during this process in order to get a valid unlocking script for the input.

3. User the instance's connected provider to send the transaction.

Remember that the tx is not actually sent anywhere in a local test because we connect to a mock provider.

### Verify the Tx input for the method call

In the previous step, the signed `tx` for the contract call and its input index are returned. You can call `verifyScript` on the returned `tx` to verify that the contract method call (in the given tx input) is successful.

```ts
let result = tx.verifyScript(atInputIndex)
console.log(result.success) // Output: true or false
```

### Integrate with a testing framework

You can use whatever testing framework you like to write unit tests for your contract. For example, a local test using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is shown below:

```js
describe('Test SmartContract `Demo`', () => {
  let signer;
  let demo;

  before(async () => {
    // compile contract
    await Demo.compile()

    // create a test wallet as signer, connected to a dummy provider
    signer = new TestWallet(privateKey, new DummyProvider())

    // initialize a contract instance
    demo = new Demo(1n, 2n)

    // connect the instance to signer
    await demo.connect(signer)
  })

  it('should pass the public method unit test successfully.', async () => {
    // call `demo.methods.add` to get a signed tx
    const { tx: callTx, atInputIndex } = await demo.methods.add(
      // pass in the right argument
      3n,
      // set method call options
      {
        // Since `demo.deploy` hasn't been called before, a fake UTXO of the contract should be passed in.
        fromUTXO: dummyUTXO
      } as MethodCallOptions<Demo>
    )

    let result = callTx.verifyScript(atInputIndex)
    expect(result.success, result.error).to.eq(true)
  })

  it('should pass the non-public method unit test', () => {
    expect(demo.sum(3n, 4n)).to.be.eq(7n)
  })

  it('should throw error', () => {
    return expect(
	  // Using the wrong argument when calling this function just results in an error.
      demo.methods.add(4n, { fromUTXO: dummyUTXO })
    ).to.be.rejectedWith(/add check failed/)
  })
})
```

 ## Test a Stateful Contract

Stateful contact testing is very similar to what we have described above. The only different is that you have to be aware of smart contract instance changes after method calls.

As described in the [Overview](./how-to-write-a-contract/stateful-contract.md#overview), for each method call, a tx contains new contract UTXO(s) with the latest updated state, i.e., the next instance. From the perspective of the current spending tx, the public `@method` of a contract instance is called in one of its inputs, and the next contract instance is stored in one (or more) of its outputs.

Now, let's look at how to test the `incrementOnChain` method call:

```ts
// initialize the first instance, i.e., deployment
let counter = new Counter(0n);
// connect it to a signer
counter.connect(dummySigner());

// set the current instance to be the first instance
let current = counter;

// create the next instance from the current
let nextInstance = current.next();

// apply the same updates on the next instance locally
nextInstance.increment();

// call the method of current instance to apply the updates on chain
const { tx: tx_i, atInputIndex } = await current.methods.incrementOnChain(
  {
    // Since `counter.deploy` hasn't been called before, a fake UTXO of the contract should be passed in.
    fromUTXO: getDummyContractUTXO(balance),

    // the `next` instance and its balance should be provided here
    next: {
      instance: nextInstance,
      balance
    }
  } as MethodCallOptions<Counter>
);

// check the validity of the input script generated for the method call.
let result = tx_i.verifyScript(atInputIndex);
expect(result.success, result.error).to.eq(true);

```

In general, we call the method of a stateful contract in 3 steps:

### 1. Build the `current` instance

The `current` instance refers to the contract instance containing the latest state on the blockchain. The first instance is in the deployment transaction. In the above example, we initialize the `current` instance to be the first instance like this:

```ts
let current = counter;
```

### 2. Create a `next` instance and apply updates to it off chain

The `next` instance is the new instance in the UTXO of the method calling tx.

To create the `next` of a specific contract instance, you can simply call `next()` on it:

```ts
let nextInstance = instance.next();
```

It will make a deep copy of all properties and methods of `instance` to create a new one.

Then, you should apply all the state updates to the `next` instance. Please note that these are just local/off-chain updates and are yet to be applied to the blockchain.

```ts
nextInstance.increment();
```
This is the **SAME** method we call on chain in `incrementOnChain`, thanks to the fact that both the on-chain smart contract and off-chain code are written in TypeScript.

### 3. Call the method on the `current` instance to apply updates on chain

As described in [this section](#call-a-public-method), we can build a call transaction. The only difference here is that we pass in the `next` instance and its balance as a method call option in a stateful contract. So the method (i.e., `incrementOnChain`) have all the information to verify that all updates made to the `next` instance follow the state transition rules in it.

```ts
const { tx: tx_i, atInputIndex } = await current.methods.incrementOnChain(
  {
    // Since `counter.deploy` hasn't been called before, a fake UTXO of the contract should be passed in.
    fromUTXO: getDummyContractUTXO(balance),

    // the `next` instance and its balance should be provided here
    next: {
      instance: nextInstance,
      balance
    }
  } as MethodCallOptions<Counter>
);
```

Finally, we can check the validity of the method call as before.

```ts
let result = tx_i.verifyScript(atInputIndex);
expect(result.success, result.error).to.eq(true);
```

### Running the tests

As before, we can just use the following command:

```sh
npm run test
```
